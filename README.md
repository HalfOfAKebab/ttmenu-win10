# ttmenu-win10
It's a skin for TTMenu that looks like Windows 10.

If you find any bugs or have any ideas, feel free to open an issue, but I probably won't ever touch this again after I finish setting up this repo, so don't hold your breath.

# Screenshots 
Add some of these later idiot

# Installation
I recommend making a backup of "TTMenu\skin\default" before installing this skin, just in case you somehow mess up or want to go back.

Extract the zip to the "TTMenu\skin" directory, merging the Windows 10 skin's "default" folder with the one already on your card (if there is one). Say yes to overwriting any files. Done.
